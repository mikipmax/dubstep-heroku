            We reserve the right to change, alter, replace or otherwise modify these Terms of Use at any time. The date of last modification is stated at the end of these Terms of Use. It is your responsibility to check this page from time to time for updates.

When we make any updates to these Terms of Use, we will highlight this fact on the Website. In addition, if you register an account and these Terms of Use are subsequently changed in any material respect (for example, for security, legal, or regulatory reasons), we will notify you in advance by sending a message to your SoundCloud® account and/or an email to the email address that you have provided to us, and the revised Terms of Use will become effective six (6) weeks after such notification. You will have no obligation to continue using the Platform following any such notification, but if you do not terminate your account as described in the Termination section below during such six (6) week period, your continued use of the Platform after the end of that six (6) week period will constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <h2>Grant of Licence</h2>
        <p>
            By uploading or posting Your Content to the Platform, you initiate an automated process to transcode any audio Content and direct SoundCloud to store Your Content on our servers, from where you may control and authorise the use, reproduction, transmission, distribution, public display, public performance, making available and other communication to the public of Your Content on the Platform and elsewhere using the Services. To the extent it is necessary in order for SoundCloud to provide you with any of the aforementioned hosting services, to undertake any of the tasks set forth in these Terms of Use and/or to enable your use of the Platform, you hereby grant such licences to SoundCloud on a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully paid basis.

By uploading Your Content to the Platform, you also grant a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid up, licence to other users of the Platform, and to operators and users of any other websites, apps and/or platforms to which Your Content has been shared or embedded using the Services (“Linked Services”), to use, copy, repost, transmit or otherwise distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, adapt, prepare derivative works of, compile, make available and otherwise communicate to the public, Your Content utilising the features of the Platform from time to time, and within the parameters set by you using the Services. You can limit and restrict the availability of certain of Your Content to other users of the Platform, and to users of Linked Services, at any time using the settings on the sound page for each sound you upload, subject to the provisions of the Disclaimer section below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in these Terms of Use grants any rights to any other user of the Platform with respect to any proprietary name, logo, trademark or service mark uploaded by you as part of Your Content (for example, your profile picture) (“Marks”), other than the right to reproduce, publicly display, make available and otherwise communicate to the public those Marks, automatically and without alteration, as part of the act of reposting sounds with which you have associated those Marks.

The licences granted in this section are granted separately with respect to each item of Your Content that you upload to the Platform. Licences with respect to audio Content, and any images or text within your account, will (subject to the following paragraph of these Terms of Use) terminate automatically when you remove such Content from your account. Licences with respect to comments or other contributions that you make on the Platform will be perpetual and irrevocable, and will continue notwithstanding any termination of your account.

Removal of audio Content from your account will automatically result in the deletion of the relevant files from SoundCloud’s systems and servers. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, you hereby acknowledge and agree that once Your Content is distributed to a Linked Service, SoundCloud is not obligated to ensure the deletion of Your Content from any servers or systems operated by the operators of any Linked Service, or to require that any user of the Platform or any Linked Service deletes any item of Your Content.

Any Content other than Your Content is the property of the relevant Uploader, and is or may be subject to copyright, trademark rights or other intellectual property or proprietary rights. Such Content may not be downloaded, reproduced, distributed, transmitted, re-uploaded, republished, displayed, sold, licensed, made available or otherwise communicated to the public or exploited for any purposes except via the features of the Platform from time to time and within the parameters set by the Uploader on the Platform or with the express written consent of the Uploader. Where you repost another user’s Content, or include another user’s Content in a set, you acquire no ownership rights whatsoever in that Content. Subject to the rights expressly granted in this section, all rights in Content are reserved to the relevant Uploader.
        </p>
        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>
            You may terminate this Agreement at any time by sending notice in writing to SoundCloud at Rheinsberger Str. 76/77, 10115 Berlin, Germany confirming such termination, by removing all of Your Content from your account, by deleting your account and thereafter by ceasing to use the Platform. If you have a Pro Account, and terminate this Agreement before the end of your subscription, we are unable to offer any refund for any unexpired period of your subscription.

SoundCloud may suspend your access to the Platform and/or terminate this Agreement at any time if (i) you are deemed to be a Repeat Infringer as described above; (ii) you are in breach of any of the material provision of these Terms of Use or our Community Guidelines, including without limitation, the provisions of the following sections: Your Use of the Platform, Your Content, Grant of Licence , and Your Representations and Warranties; (iii) SoundCloud elects at its discretion to cease providing access to the Platform in the jurisdiction where you reside or from where you are attempting to access the Platform, or (iv) in other reasonable circumstances as determined by SoundCloud at its discretion. If you have a Pro Account and your account is suspended or terminated by SoundCloud pursuant to (i) or (ii) above, you will not be entitled to any refund for any unexpired period of your subscription. If your account is terminated pursuant to (iii) or (iv), refunds may be payable at the reasonable discretion of SoundCloud.

Once your account has been terminated, any and all Content residing in your account, or pertaining to activity from your account (for example, data relating to the distribution or consumption of your sounds), will be irretrievably deleted by SoundCloud, except to the extent that we are obliged or permitted to retain such content, data or information for a certain period of time in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and/or to protect our legitimate business interests. You are advised to save or back up any material that you have uploaded to your account before terminating your account, as SoundCloud assumes no liability for any material that is irretrievably deleted following any termination of your account. SoundCloud is not able to provide you with any .csv or other similar file of data relating to activity associated with your account, whether before or after termination or cancellation. This data is provided and is accessible only for viewing via your account page on the Website for as long as your account is active.

If you access the Platform via any of our Apps or via any third party app connected to your account, deleting that app will not delete your account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from the Account page within your Settings on the Website.

The provisions of these Terms of Use that are intended by their nature to survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement will survive the termination of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, those Sections entitled Your SoundCloud Account, Your Content, Grant of Licence , Representations and Warranties, Liability for Content, Disclaimer, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, Termination and Right of Cancellation, Assignment to Third Parties, Severability, Entire Agreement, and Applicable Law and Jurisdiction, respectively.
